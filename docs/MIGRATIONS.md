## Overview

Migrations are a central component to scalable architecture. A good migration library will allow you to declare schema in a database-agnostic way, and will provide drivers for migrating that schema to several different database platforms. At Tiqtok, we are using [node-db-migrate](https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate). Although migrations will automatically be run for you initially, it is important to understand how they worker

## Running migrations

To run a migration, navigate to your Tiqtok-api dir and type
```bash
db-migrate up
```

To create a new migration, navigate to your TiqTok-api dir and type
```bash
db-migrate create adds-something-to-db
```

## How it works

Migrations work by reading a database.json file in the location where the command is run. In our app, a database.json file is generated by vagrant for us with the appropriate credentials set up. If you decide to switch database platforms, the configuration within the database.json file is the only change necessary.
